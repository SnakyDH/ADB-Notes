# Views
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM table1;
```
Generate a table 2 from table 1

## Classification:
- Common: 
Result of a query
It haven't own data 
Only use for query
Unique name in database
Create a view for other view
Can have updated data of the tables used
`CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT * FROM table1;`
`SELECT * FROM view_name;`
I can use:
`CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT * FROM table1;`
`CREATE VIEW view_name (column1, column2) SELECT * FROM table1;`
`DROP VIEW view_name;`
`ALTER VIEW view_name AS SELECT * FROM table1;`
`CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS SELECT * FROM table1;`
- Materialized:
Same as common view but it have own data so it only can look at the data when it was created because is a copy of the data or a picture of the data
`CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW view_name AS SELECT * FROM table1;`
`SELECT * FROM view_name;`
I can use:
`CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW view_name AS SELECT * FROM table1;`
`CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW view_name (column1, column2) SELECT * FROM table1;`
`DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW view_name;`
`ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW view_name AS SELECT * FROM table1;`
`CREATE OR REPLACE MATERIALIZED VIEW view_name AS SELECT * FROM table1;`
